## Node Crash Course
I made this by following a node crash course I found on Youtube which you can watch by following this link: [Node Crash Course - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4&t=3304s)

## About Project
This is a very simple node http server with a homepage and an about me page. 

It's simple javascript, html, and css; nothing too flashy or special. My main goal was to just simply get it up and running. 

# How To Visit Site
The easiest way to look at this project is to visit it via Heroku: [My First Node Server](https://still-forest-28138.herokuapp.com/)
I have it hosted on here for those who simply just want to see it running, but for those who want to see the code follow the steps below.

## Run server via command line

Firstly, you need to clone this repo onto your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/nataliejuner/node_http_server.git
```
cd into the project file:
```
cd node_http_server
```
start server several ways:
```
node index
